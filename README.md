# Varbergs fortress

## Purpose
I do like history alot and I am missing something "nice" to enjoy the history of Varberg fortress beside all the basic information around and books about the place.
So I wanna make a timeline about all the centuries the fortress been around.

## Content
The content of the webpage is a compitlation most from the book Varbergs historia written 1963 by Albert Sandklef. But I also includes old maps, paintings and old newspaper articles.
I have implementet a simple darkmode that the "theme" of the system controls.
